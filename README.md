## Choice of language
Java with Spark <https://sparkjava.com/documentation#getting-started> (Maven project) 

Why?
* Platform independent (Develop on Windows, run on Linux)
* Popular language with extensive documentation
* Easy for future teams to inherit code
* All team members are familiar with the language
* Similar to flask (no members have worked with Flask, Spark is easy to get running)
* Reasonable learning curve
* Straight forward enough for small projects
* We know from experience that Java works well with SqLite
